# Proof-writing Systems
- One can verify existing proofs with Lean.
- Google's AlphaProof can generate such texts artificially.
- But if there was a large text file of which Lean says its correct, would this count as *insight*? If our position was that Mathematics is nothing but formal logic, this would be the case.

# Aesthetics in Mathematics
- Why is Mathematics beautiful?
	- Nature is beautiful, and mathematics is analogous to nature
		- very limited, although there are applications in Physics for higher math.
	- Proofs can be elegant, very short, intuitive, instructive
	- It is *fun* to form a connection between existing fields, or theorems
		- better but in essence: Math is the closest we reach absolute truth. Working with mathematical concepts, one "forgets" (i. e., they are accepted subconsously) that their constructed (at the beginning, axiomatically). Then, an unexpected Theorem, discovery is meaningful

# Art
- Why is Art Good?
	- *Good Taste* signifies Status. It requires Education and Capital. It is exlusive (exclusionary) by Definition.
		- Try to overcome this! Kitsch is Good.
- So Ask again: Why is Art beautiful?
	- Because it is analogous (in some abstract way) to Nature (which is beautiful? No), which we crave?
		- Because we can escape Reality?
	- Because it builds Community? (Music, esp. Singing)
	- Because we cant quite explain it

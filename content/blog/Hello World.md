During my Studies at University, at my Job as a Programmer, or during side projects, I often come across topics / problems / solutions worth sharing. I intend to publish short, self-contained posts here.
# Potential Topics
Blog-posts will fall into 2 categories: mathematics or computer science. In the foreseeable future, the won't be philosophical or cultural posts, although I don't want to close this possibility off entirely.
